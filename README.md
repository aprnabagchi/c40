1# added all the images inside preload()function in sketch.js by using loadImage() function

2# added images for the cars using addImage()function, track image using image()function and ground image using background()function

3# added end condition inside game.js, created end()function and inside sketch.js we have defined whenever gameState reaches 2 it should call end()function

4# added RESET button inside form.js, set the position and given the logic that whenever we press RESET button it should reset playerCount and gameState to 0 by using updateCount() and update() function from Player class and Game class respectively.


That's it ....:)
